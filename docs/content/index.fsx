ges-runner [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Exira.EventStore.Runner.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Exira.EventStore.Runner/)
======================

Wrapper that uses [Topshelf](http://topshelf-project.com/) to run [EventStore]([https://geteventstore.com/](https://geteventstore.com/)) as a Windows Service.

### Usage

To install do the following:

  * Download `Event Store` from [https://geteventstore.com/](https://geteventstore.com/)

  * Download a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/exira/ges-runner/releases) and unzip somewhere, for example `C:\ges-runner\`

  * Update `Runner.yaml` file with location to `EventStore.ClusterNode.exe` to run and the `.esconfig` you wish to use, according to [YAML documentation](http://docs.geteventstore.com/server/3.3.0/command-line-arguments/)

  * Run the `Install.ps1` script with the same servicename you configured in `Runner.yaml`, for example: `powershell ./Install.ps1 -servicename ges`

  * Instead you can also simply run one of the following:
    * `ges-runner.exe install`
    * `ges-runner.exe start`
    * `ges-runner.exe stop`
    * `ges-runner.exe uninstall`
